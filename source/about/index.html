      	Hey there! I grew up in the small town of San Francisco, CA and recently moved to Seoul, South Korea to experience the big city. I enjoy telling stories with data and aspire to build products that utilize technology to unobtrusively solve issues in the built and natural environment. In my free time I play outdoors and travel.

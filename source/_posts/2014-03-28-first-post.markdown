Since graduating in May of last year, I have been lucky enough to spend at least a night in 20 cities, 11 countries, in 3 continents. Some nights I staked out in swanky company hotel rooms. Others were far more humble - freezing my butt off on a stranger's couch, hoping that the person who used the sheets before me kept good hygiene. During my travels I have made some very poor decisions which I have aggregated here so that you and I will not make the same mistakes again. Here are the top few things that I wish I knew last May<!--more-->:

## Nothing will ever go as planned

Plans are important. I am a big fan of reading ahead, writing an itinerary, finding lodging etc.. With that said, plans never work out! You might take longer at a certain site than expected or you may get lost. If you are a compulsive planner like me, try to embrace the uncertainty. Plans are good guidelines but in trying to make every single site on the to do list, you will miss out on many experiences. The awesome graffiti on the wall or the pigeons trying to get lucky in the town square, these small things are what will make you smile looking back at your trip.

## Don't be greedy

In Paris, my friend and I bought the 2 day museum pass- worst decision ever. Sure we saw many sites in a short amount of time. But in our attempt to "break even" we left little time for reflection to take it all in (my fault). At the end of two days we were dead tired and at the edge of our nerves. Thankfully our next destination was Barcelona, a good place to unwind.   

## Be considerate of your travel buddy

Its not just about you! Its not just about you! Do not take for granted how wonderful it is to travel with a companion. Long trips are not always rosy and have their rocky moments. Companions are a great source of emotional support. The shared experience can create a lasting bond and turn an acquaintance into a life long friend. Sooo, realize their decision to travel with you is a choice and a sacrifice. Your companion has his or her own things they want to do, but they decided they would rather spend time with you. Make the conscious decision to do the same. Even if you didnâ€™t "accomplish" everything that you wanted to do on your trip, you will look back and cherish the memories made with the friend. 

## Beautiful things are beautiful, Ugly things are beautiful too

The Eiffel tower was stunning. But one of the most memorable moments for me was a walk through a dilapidated neighborhood in my Dad's hometown in China. Storefronts vacated and building bricks lay scattered in the middle of the street. There were no tourists and it was hard to imagine that less than 15 years ago, that area was the downtown of the city. There are many areas- even in Paris, that will not make any postcard. These are the everyday parts of the city and for me they were some of the most interesting places I visited. If you have the time, try to get off the beaten path. Go on an aimless run and try to get lost. It can make you appreciate that city as well as your home city so much more.   

## Keep in mind the kindness of others

I was very lucky to have had friends (and even strangers) show me around many of the places I visited. Some of these people I was not particularly close with, others I have not talked to in years. Keep in mind that I did not travel exclusively on weekends, they all had their own life. My college friends had papers due and finals to study for. My older friends had work. You will be surprised at how willing people are to show you around if you simply reach out. Most people take pride in their town and the best tour guides are always locals. 

I also decided to try Couchsurfing as a form of lodging and luckily a few people agreed to take me in. The nights sleeping in a stranger's apartment were some of the most meaningful of my travels. Of course remain vigilant and act with common sense. But also keep an open mind and be respectful of others. 

## Find time to travel alone

Traveling alone can be daunting, especially when travelling outside the city or in a country where you do not speak the language. But there are a few reasons to at least try it once. First, it is easier to meet people when you are alone. Go to a hostel and start talking to people. Chances are the people there are in the same situation as you. You may have a stimulating dinner conversation with one person but never see him or her again. You may end up travelling with others- it is all in the luck of the dice. Second, travelling alone allows the most time for self reflection. You don't have to worry about others, about the trip 

## Keep a journal

During your travels, you are bound to come up with a golden epiphany to the secret of life. Do not expect to remember said epiphany after downing a few drinks at the local pub- for me that would be approximately two drinks. Keep a journal, write about your day or jot down a few thoughts during the down times. Thirty years from now, you can read the entries and look back at what a life changing experience this trip was and also what naive thoughts you had at the time.    

## Shut up and listen 

 Travelling allows you to see the true nature of others. Travelling is as much about seeing the sites as it is meeting people.

#SimpleApp

###Project Description

Following human centered design principles, we envision SimpleApp as a fully functional dashboard of apps that will optimize the smartphone to the needs of the senior population. Reactive buttons and a remote portal to organize applications, SimpleApp aims to create a unified design platform for developers and distributors to reach a previously marginalized group of users.

After conducting countless hours of user interviews and testing, we presented SimpleApp at the Berkeley Mobile Startup Festival and received 2nd place overall.
